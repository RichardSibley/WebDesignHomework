            <p> <strong>D&D Homebrew</strong> is a term that refers to D&D rules that are not included in the official rules that are published by Wizards of the Coast (WOTC). 
                Homebrew can include rules that your group comes up with, or rules that your group borrows from others.It’s common for <span id="uppercase">Dungeon Masters</span> to include some homebrew in their games. Often they have certain rules that they want to change or add. 
                Or they may accidentally <i>misinterpret</i> the rules, which technically is homebrew. Sometimes players want to play <span id= "racesclasses">races, classes, or subclasses</span> that <b>aren’t</b> included in the official rules, 
                so they may ask the DM for permission to find or create or find homebrew content. If you want to use homebrew rules, you should always get approval from the DM, and you should read the rules very carefully. 
                Some homebrew content is excellent, while some is confusing, unbalanced, or simply <span id="garbage"> garbage rules.</span>
